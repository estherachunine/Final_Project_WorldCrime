# Final_Project_WorldCrime
This dataset set provides an overview of offences in the USA from 1975- 2015.
Throughout this repository, you will see the process where I found this dataset on Kaggle.
In addition, you will see how I have manipulated and cleaned this dataset through PowerQuery.
Furthermore, you will notice how I have created a data visualisation dashboard to highlight key trends and informative insights into key offending rates.
Moreover, you will see how I implemented python to illustrate positive and negative correlations across years in attempt predicative forecasting of offending rates.
Lastly, you will see how I collated the information to make a presentation slide to present to employers.
